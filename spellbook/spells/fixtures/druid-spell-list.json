You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.\n\nFlood: You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing. The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different Effect. If this Effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood Effect lasts.\n\nPart Water: You cause water in the area to move apart and create a Trench. The Trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The Trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different Effect. The water then slowly fills in the Trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.\n\nRedirect Flow: You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over Obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely Directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain Conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different Effect.\n\nWhirlpool: This Effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so. The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage, this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.",

Fissures open throughout the spell\u2019s area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the DM. Each is 1d10 x 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell\u2019s area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure\u2019s edge as it opens.\nA fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below).\n\nStructures. The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure\u2019s height must make a Dexterity saving throw.

When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed.

As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.\n\nYou retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically capable of doing so. You can't use any special senses you have (for example, darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense. You can only speak if the creature can normally speak.\n\nWhen you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal. The DM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect in that state.\n\nDuring this spell's Duration, you can use your action to assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the original form, with one exception - if your new form has more hit pints than your current one, your Hit Points remain at their current value.",
