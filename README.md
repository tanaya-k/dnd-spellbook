# Online Spellbook for Dungeons and Dragons Spellcasters

## Project Description

A website that displays spells used by Dungeons and Dragons players that come mainly from books published by the Wizards of the Coast. Users can choose from the main spells sorted by class (eg. cleric, wizard) for their character into their own 'spellbook'. Each spell has a 'spellcard' with its own descriptions, stats and restrictions.
